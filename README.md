Hello!

This project is a quick practise solution, where I create a new Genshin themed reward screen with a list of quests that have randomised progression. The outline is:

### Recreate a modified version of Genshinâ€™s Rewards screen using Common UI. The Screen must be navigable and all functionality must be available using either Gamepad or Mouse & Keyboard. 

## Current Progress
